# Code for ICAIF 2024 competition: Crypto Market Simulation for Risk Estimation

The main part of the code is based on the [Starter Kit](https://github.com/DeepIntoStreams/ICAIF_2024_cryptocurreny_hackathon_starting_kit) provided by the orginizers of the ICAIF Competition, while the [PCF-GAN](https://github.com/DeepIntoStreams/PCF-GAN) model is based on the code from the [PCF-GAN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12511).

## Environment Setup
The code has been tested successfully using Python 3.9. The list of dependencies is available in ICAIFenvironment.yml.

## Tail-Gan Model
To see the implementation of the Tail-GAN model and the corresponding metrics, see the example_notebook.ipynb file.

## PCF-Gan Model
To see the implementation of the PCF-GAN model and the corresponding metrics, see the example_notebookPCFGAN.ipynb file in testing_models/PCFGAN_main.
